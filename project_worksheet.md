# Project Title
Time of Day Themed Todo List App
## Description
Our todo list app will be a todo list app that can be categorized for different times of the day. Normally, traditional todo list apps are from a day's view in its entirety. With our app, you will be able to have a todo list you can generate, add, modify and delete tasks for the morning, during the day, and the evening.

## MVP/Post-MVP
### MVP
- planning directory that sufficiently demonstrates the team's planning process
- equal commits from all group members
- team page to show case each member's picture, passion and contribution to the project
- two separate repositories for frontend and backend

Frontend:
- use react router for multiple views
- communicate with backend API RESTfully (fetch or axios)
- be responsive and work on mobile phones, tablets, desktops
- passes props correctly from their respective component
- establishing routes for each todo list (morning, day, evening)
- overview component will preview 1-2 todo tasks of each list (morning, day, evening)
- deploy to gh-pages

Backend:
- have at least 2 models, more if needed, and one association
- CRUD functionality (create a todo task, reading section of day's tasks, update a todo task, delete a todo task)
- set up Mongo and Mongoose installs
- create all routes/functionality for CRUD
- create seed.js to contain morning, day and evening attributes that starts as an empty array and accepts Strings (which would be the user's to do tasks that they generate)
- upload the backend API to heroku, setup to be accessible with fetches when building out frontend

Presentation:
- equal presentation time for each team member (2.5 minutes each)
### Post-MVP
- CSS styling
- smooth animations of collapsing or expanding the individual task lists
- obtaining user's local time, date and weather
- dynamic user greeting based upon their local time
- random generated backgrounds based on time of day user gets into app
- adding audio to certain executions on webpage (i.e. deleting a task or adding a task)
