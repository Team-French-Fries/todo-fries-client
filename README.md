# Full Stack React Application - Todo Application with Time of Day Focus

Our group (Victor Esonu, Devin Jansa, Nicholas Meade and Trey Williams) in the General Assembly [Software Engineering Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive-remote) created a Full Stack React Application for our project - a Todo Application with Time of Day focus.

## Goals of our application

We decided to create a Todo application that takes a twist on normal Todo applications. Our goal was to have a focus on the user being able to selectively choose the time of day they create, modify and delete their todos they make.

Three times of day are the focus - Morning, Afternoon and Evening. We believe this approach can make a more useful Todo app user experience to maintain their focus on completing their tasks throughout the day, instead of seeing 10+ tasks all at once at the very start of the day.

### Technologies used

React, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose. The [backend](https://github.com/Team-French-Fries/todo-fries-api) will be deployed on Heroku. The [frontend](https://github.com/Team-French-Fries/todo-fries-client) will be deployed on Github Pages.

### General approach for creating our application

#### Backend approach

We decided on a two schema/model approach. Our wireframes for our schema/model development can be found [here](https://wireframe.cc/ukyPzy), which also contains the wireframes for our frontend vision. We initially had a goal of three schemas/models, but decided on two for our first version.

The task list schema/model is used for creating/updating/deleting an individual todo generated by the user. This schema/model also includes a Boolean of "completed" - a goal for future versions would be to utilize this for allowing the user to decide if their todo was completed or not.

The time of day schema/model is used for housing a collection of todos generated by the user for a specific time of the day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening), which is accomplished by the association of the task list schema/model within the time of day schema/model.

Two controllers (timeController, todoController) were created to make the CRUD methods for each schema/model, which is integrated into our frontend React applciation by using fetch requests.

#### Frontend approach

Planning our frontend included making a [roadmap](https://wireframe.cc/lbP3m1) of our component structure. Our goal for the frontend React application is mobile focused, with the only change that occurs in our first version goals is our navigation bar defaulting to an 'Overview' page to look at the user's todos based on the time of day at a glance, with clicking a hamburger menu to click on a time of day, which would collapse the other times of the day and expand the chosen time of day from the menu. On larger screen views the times of day to choose from would be shown directly in the navigation bar instead of a hamburger menu.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
